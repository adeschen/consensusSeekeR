Title: Detection of consensus regions inside a group of experiences using
    genomic positions and genomic ranges
Description: This package compares genomic positions and genomic ranges from
    multiple experiments to extract common regions. The size of the analyzed 
    region is adjustable as well as the number of experiences in which a 
    feature must be present in a potential region to tag this region as a 
    consensus region. In genomic analysis where feature identification 
    generates a position value surrounded by a genomic range, such as ChIP-Seq 
    peaks and nucleosome positions, the replication of an experiment may result 
    in slight differences between predicted values. This package enables the 
    conciliation of the results into consensus regions.
